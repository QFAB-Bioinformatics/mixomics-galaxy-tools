Description
===========

A biplot displays information on both samples and variables. You can interpret a biplot in the following ways:

* The cosine of the angle between a vector and an axis indicates the 
  importance of the contribution of he corresponding variable to the axis dimension.

* The cosine of the angel betwen vectors indicates correlation between 
  variables. Highly correlated variables point in the same direction; 
  uncorrelated variables are at right angles to each other.

* Points that are close to each other in the biplot represent observations with similar values.

* You can approximate the coordinates of an observation by projecting 
  the point onto the variable vectors with the biplot.
